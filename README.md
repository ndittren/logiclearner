# Logic Learner

Logic Learner is an online learning tool that helps computer science, engineering, and mathematics students improve their fluency and problem solving process in writing proofs for propositional logic.

## Logic Learner Tools

Logic Learner makes use of Logic Learner Tools for the feedback portion of the application. Logic Learner Tools provides detection of syntax errors, propositional laws errors, and statement errors.
Logic Learner Tools is found here: https://pypi.org/project/logiclearnertools/

## Configuration

1. Clone

    git clone https://github.com/ccnmtl/logiclearner.git
    
    cd logiclearner

2. Create the database

   For Postgres:
     * Create a database user/password (if needed)
     * Create the database `createdb logiclearner`

3. Customize settings

    * Create a local_settings.py file in the `logiclearner` subdirectory OR
    * Copy `logiclearner/settings_shared.py` to `logiclearner/local_settings.py`
    * Then, override the variables from `settings_shared.py` that you need to customize for your local installation.
      * Customize your `DATABASES` dictionary
        * e.g. set NAME, HOST, USER, and PASSWORD. remove PORT (unless it's non-standard)

4. Build the virtual environment

   `make` will build the virtualenv

5. Migrate the database

   `./manage.py migrate`

6. Run
    
    Use `make dev` This is equivalent to running Django's ./manage.py runserver in one shell and Webpack in another. The output from both will be printed to the shell. Use CTR-C to exit.
    
    To test, use `make all` This is what Travis and Jenkins runs to build the project.
